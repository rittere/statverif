of cryptographic protocols.

INSTALL

* from packages

To run this software, you need Objective Caml version 3.00 or
higher. For installation instructions see
http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html.

Binary packages are provided for Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 26. StatVerif
is also available via opam as package statverif. 

* from source code

On Mac OS X, you need to install XCode if you do not
already have it. It can be downloaded from
	https://developer.apple.com/xcode/


* under Unix / Mac

The source is available on github. Building it requires ocaml,
ocamlbuild and ocamlfind which should be available from the same place
as ocaml. Download the source with

git clone https://github.com/rittere/statverif.git

Then cd into the directory statverif-1.97 and type

make
sudo make install

This will create a binary called statverif and place it in /usr/local/bin.

* under Windows

The best way to run statverif under Windows is to use the package
provided in opam. 



USAGE

This software contains two executable programs, statverif and statveriftotex. 

The program statverif takes as input a description of a cryptographic
protocol possibly with state, and checks whether it satisfies secrecy, authenticity, or
equivalence properties. The description of the protocol can have
several different formats. The recommended format is the typed pi
calculus format, which is a dialect of the applied pi calculus (Abadi
and Fournet, POPL'01).  The description of the protocol is first
translated into Horn clauses, then the core of the verifier is called.
Examples of protocol descriptions can be found in the webexamples subdirectory.
To run these examples, use 
        statverif <filename>
	
The program statveriftotex takes as input a protocol description
and converts it into a LaTeX file. This is useful for including
protocols in research papers.
